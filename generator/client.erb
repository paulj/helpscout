# Help Scout API V1 Client
# http://developer.helpscout.net/
#
# Authentication
# This is an HTTPS-only API. Authentication will be based on API Keys, which can
# be generated the Help Scout UI in the User Profile. Each API Key will map to 
# an existing Help Scout user. Results returned from various responses will be 
# based upon the role of the user to which the API key is tied.
#
# The API Key will be passed via HTTP Basic Authentication. The API Key will go 
# in the username field and a dummy password, such as X, in the password field.
#
# Rate Limiting
# Requests will be limited to 200 requests per minute. Response code 429 will 
# be returned when throttle limit has been reached. A "Retry-After" header will
#  be returned indicating how many seconds to wait until retry.
#
# Formats
# Each endpoint will specify the response format in the URL. However, the API
# will only support JSON at this time.
#
# Usage
# 1. Follow the instructions at Help Scout's Developers site to generate an API 
#    key: http://developer.helpscout.net/
# 2. Add your API Key to config/helpscout.yml:
#    api_key: XXXXXX
# 3. Initialize your Help Scout client:
#    HelpScout::Client.new
# 4. You may now query the Help Scout API:
#    mailboxes = HelpScout::Client.mailboxes
#
# You may also initialize a client without using helpscout.yml by passing the
# API Key to new:
# HelpScout::Client.new(XXXXXX)
